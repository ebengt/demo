# At work we had a system with a database, where the interface was Java. Or a script that called Java.
# Builds where run by Python. Or a script that called Python.
# Handling these two was an erlang distributer.
# However, it took many seconds to start Python. To speed things up I changed to Erlang FFI
# for Python, and then for Java too.
# Funnily enough the Java FFI is really slow to start on my home computer. So slow that the author
# had to add two special config values just for me. Otherwise the FFI timed out.
# See the timing for just one build below.
# At work we hade 1500 builds, and a much faster Java FFI start.

# To do this you need Erlang, Java and Python2 installed. Also rebar3 for Erlang.
# Erlang and Java has to match versions. Ie, I have Erlang 19 and Java 1.8. 1.7 did not work with 19.
# Follow build/Guide, db/Guide, dist/Guide and dist_no_ffi/Guide

# Then time the ffi verison vs no_ffi version for one target.
